The main program is in main_RL.py. Change mathematical modeling, the data, and the parameters if necessary. Before using the main program, it also finds some parameters, such as gamma, velocity, and exposed class with find_v_gamma_e.py. Lastly, use correlation_visual to process data about the Pearson coefficient from main_RL.py for visualization.

Data that need:
- Daily number of infection
- Density of population of each borough
- The bed capacity of each borough
